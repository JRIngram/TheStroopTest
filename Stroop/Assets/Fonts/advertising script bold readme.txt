Advertsing Script is a brush script typeface inspired by a handmade sample drawn by the calligrapher Ross Frederic George and depicted in  Speedball 1947 Textbook  Manual. Advertsing Script has a vintage brush script look, perfect for food packaging, display and logo design and period advertising.

Advertising Script covers over 40 languages that use the Latin alphabet, with a full range of accents and diacritics. It comes in three weights plus a special monoline weight and a rough variant.

The original design has been completely reworked and extended by the Zetafonts Masterclass 2016 Team to provide three lighter weights, a rough and a monoline variant, and to produce an extended character set with open type support for ligatures, alternates, European languages and ending swashes.

Advertising Script makes full use of Open Type ligatures to provide swashes, alternates and a wide array of ligature characters for a more handmade, natural look. Swashes can be accessed through glyph palette or by typing one to six underscores after the letter. And ligature is accessed by typing double ampersand.
Take care: open type features are developed using open type technology, fully compatible with Adobe software and major design softwares and OS, but not supported by every software. Check before buying!
